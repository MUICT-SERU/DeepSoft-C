ISLANDORA-1,When a user is created we will create an object in Fedora to act as the users personal collection space.,As per the IR requirements when a user logs in they should see their personal collection.  To enable this we will create an object in Fedora everytime a user in Drupal is created (assuming if a user in Drupal is deleted we will keep the objects in Fedora???).   Using Drupal's hook_user we should be able to create the object in Fedora if Drupal is using LDAP or drupal based authentication.  We will have to create the collection using a user that is allowed to create collections so we will add an admin user text box to the admin interface.  This user will have to have the Drupal administrator role.  ,Scholar Module 6.x (Deprecated),0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

There is some code that is currently using a little bit of doxygen commenting, but it would be nice to have it standardized. Perhaps something doesn't get committed unless its documented.  I started a bit of a wiki page about the documentation here: https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/ISLANDORA/Coding+Standards+and+Commenting+*draft*  I took api/dublin_core.inc and marked it up using Doxygen comments. The comments aren't all accurate, since I wanted to use @throws to show how to denote exceptions and other features.   I have included the dublin_core.inc file.

ISLANDORA-212,Treat collections as content models,"This is a requirement of ISLANDORA-171, because that ticket required giving the user the ability to view other aspects of a collection besides just looking at an XSLT-rendered view of its items. We needed a new view of the items that could allow _alter hooks to slip in their own options in an analogue to Drupal's Views Bulk Operations module.  The current approach, which treats every object like it might be a collection, has caused several long-standing problems.  - QUERY and COLLECTION_VIEW datastreams were requested on every page load, whether an object was a collection or not. This fills up Fedora's error log with stack traces and is an unnecessary couple of server-side http requests for the majority of objects in a collection  - Book objects, which have related page objects, but we normally don't want to look or act like collections, will still show a grid of page thumbnails below the proper book view interface.  This is ugly and required us to create a special ilives_book_viewer menu item for the ilives project, when we could have just used the standard content model ShowFieldSets workflow.  - Detailed List of Content, Add Datastream forms, purge and ingest buttons, DisplayFIeldSets output and collection items all appear vertically on the page, some in collapsed fieldsets, and some not. This makes for a cluttered interface.  Adding yet another function related to collections into this current framework would have just compounded the ugly look and feel of such an item view.  Required changes are:   - Turn CollectionClass.inc into a full-fledged content model, with a DisplayInFieldsets function that performs the collection query and COLLECTION_VIEW rendering.   - Allow a content model to contribute one or more tabs to the final rendering of an item. This way we can have one tab for the standard view of a collection, and another tab for the manage / bulk operations view required by ISLANDORA-171.   - Create a class, FedoraObject, that is a content model class for effectively every Fedora object. This will create a tab where we will put the Detailed List of Contents, purge, etc. buttons, and Add Datastream form. Typically this tab will only be visible to users with elevated privileges, and be the equivalent to a Fedora Admin Client view of an object.  This has the added nicety of removing yet another special case that we've had to work around - having to ignore some content model relationships and not others.",Islandora Module (Core),0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
ISLANDORA-214,Create hook so solution pack modules can declare required fedora objects,"We have had problems in the past when pushing through changes to content model streams. It was necessary to manually check if a particular repository had an older version of an ISLANDORACM stream attached to its content models, and if so to manually replace the stream.   There should be a hook invoked by the core module, hook_required_fedora_objects, that asks any solution pack modules if they specifically need any objects to be present in Fedora in order to function properly.  If they aren't there the user should be given a link to the install demo objects tab of the admin setting spage, where they can install or update the missing object(s).  Modules that implement this hook can optionally include a version number in their return array,.

It seems that buildQDCForm from plugins/FormBuilder.inc (https://github.com/Islandora/islandora/blob/6.x/plugins/FormBuilder.inc#L319) seems to work, but that seems very unintuitive.

ISLANDORA-302,PDF thumbnail creation fails on certain PDF's on CentOS,"Summary: There are issues with pdf CM relating to certain pdf's and certain versions of ImageMagick. The issue affects CentOS servers especially. Ubuntu servers are not currently affected due to the version of ImageMagick they are running.  Problem: PDF's created by some applications e.g. Adobe Illustrator and Indesign are failing to create TN datastreams and producing a variety of errors on varying servers. This is most pronounced in CentOS 5.4 and 5.5. The result is that the ingest usually completes with errors but has no TN to display in the views.  Solution: CentOS 5x by default is running Imagemagick 6.28 and uses Ghostscript 8.15. Downloading ImageMagick-6.7.1-0.x86_64.rpm for centos 5 from http://www.imagemagick.org/download/linux/CentOS/x86_64/ImageMagick-6.7.1-1.x86_64.rpm , removing the current ImageMagick packages with yum, and installing the downloaded rpm will partially address the issue. It appears you also need to upgrade ghostscript as a minimum by using yum upgrade ghostscript which should bring you to a minimum of version 8.7.  These steps will get thumbnail creation working but this version of Imagemagick will produce thumbs with a black background if the pdf is transparent. Adding a -alpha Off paramater to the convert syntax in our module function (plugins/ImageManipulation.inc -- function createThumbnailFromPDF) will get the pdf transparency work properly for jpg pdf's.  Tests run on Ubuntu which is running ImageMagick 6.6.2-6 and Ghostscript 9.01 work out of the box on the pdf's in question but also run fine with the additional -alpha Off parameter in the module convert command and suffer from no transparency issues in either configuration.  I would be more comfortable with Ghostscript 9.01 running on CentOS as well but have not located a reliable package at this time and am reluctant to advise a compiled approach as a solution for what is already a tedious upgrade path for our stack. The upgrade path described here for CentOS is relatively simple and seems to resolve the issues albeit requiring a minor code change in a basic module function. Note that the issue the code modification addresses is one created by the version of ImageMagick which is a later release than Ubuntu's package may indicate that is a positive step to take in any case.  Attached file(s) can be used to test as an example of a file that a) fails to build a thumbnail and (tnfails.pdf) b) fails on transparency without the -alpha Off switch (transfails.pdf) should you want to test output at various stages.  To Do: 1) It would be nice to upgrade Ghostscript on CentOS 5x to see how that impacts this from the code/module perspective although that is more work than the minor code fix 2) We could also check on CentOS 6x to see if the IM and GS versions have caught up 3) Move the -alpha Off switch in the convert functions in question in Imagemanipulation.inc pending approval at committers  Questions:  1) Do we apply to a) tagged relase v11.1 as well as master or  do we apply at all 2) This has prompted discussions re the TN dsid in terms of standard size and possibility of  3) should the function in play here (createThumbnailFromPDF) be using conditionals there currently or just assume our base server stack (LINUX)",PDF Solution Pack,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

ISLANDORA-307,FOR DISCUSSION: Bulk Ingest - Current .zip method does not support large file uploads.,"I was speaking today with Peter and Gervais - the current .zip ingest method (built by Alan) fails on large zip files. Attempts to address the problem with a longer window for server requests and permitting larger sizes are untenable. In the short term, this means that CAIRN books cannot be successfully uploaded at present because of their size. However, the larger issue is one of bulk ingesting items into Fedora. It's been over a year, and we still don't have a good tool for builk ingest.  After talking with Peter and Gervais, I agree that an immediate thing that we need to do is to put file checking on the .zip file, so if a .zip file is too large (they are playing with this now and should be able to give us a good ballpark size) the file is rejected. There is another piece here - an empty .zip file should also generate a meaningful error to a user.   In the longer term, we need a real bulk upload solution. I believe Peter was suggesting that if a .zip file is too large, the ideal thing would be for it to be automatically unzipped and then the files ingested individually. I may have that wrong. So, this may be two tickets rolled into one: 1. File checking on .zips in the current model, 2. A sustainable way for users to upload big files, and directories (bulk) into Fedora.

The result is the creation of a text embedded PDF that will be indexed and made searchable.  We can do this with our ABBYY software, but have not yet provided this functionality with tesseract.  In the book sp we do not have any fulltext search options at the book level as only the pages contain OCR.  When conducting a fulltext search, no faceting is available as the the page as no metadata is present.  Having a PDF at the book level that is text based and index will help create a more robust search.

ISLANDORA-525,islandora path aliases,"I'm not sure if this has ever been brought up, but a client was wondering if the url /fedora/repository/pid:123 could be changed. I've been thinking about this as well. Especially on public sites this could be useful.  Drupal has a core module called path, which you can use to create path aliases for any existing path. It also has a contrib module called pathauto in which you can set paths per node type, user or taxonomy combined with token placeholders. All path aliases created by the path module (manually) or pathauto (automatically) are being stored in the same table. I've been playing around with it a bit and we can provide aliases for our objects. We should be able to create, update and delete path aliases on CRUD function calls.  Important to know about path aliases is that the original url's (fedora/repository/pid:123) are still used by all islandora modules and so they should. It only provides an alias, it doesn't replace the original url.  I'm not sure if we can hook into pathauto for this, but it should be fairly easy to create this ourselves. We don't have token placeholders for fedora objects. In drupal you can create your own tokens, but I haven't tried it. If we can't hook into the token module, it shouldn't be difficult to create a few basic tokens ourselves. We could create a placeholder for PID, dc:title and content model for example.  Main obstacle here are the links we create in collection objects. In order for links to use the path alias instead of the original url, links need to be processed with the drupal l() or url() function. I've tried and aliases work fine in drupal menu's or breadcrumbs, but not in collection objects because links here are generated directly to html as <a> elements. Php function calls in xslt are possible, but I also understand that nobody gets excited by that thought.  So we need to do a few things: 1) Create an interface define aliases with placeholders, if not leveraging pathauto, then custom made. 2) See if token support is possible, if not leveraging token module, then custom made. (if we are able to create fedora object tokens, this will come in handy in other scenarios as well.) 3) Update the path alias table on CRUD function calls 4) Get rid of xslt to create collection views or perform php function calls from the xslt. (or on page load use jquery/ajax to update all the urls, but that's a very ugly hack :)",Pathauto,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I've heard from Paul that collections cannot sort with descriptive metadata fields that repeat and how it can break the feature.   A DGI client came up with a possible solution. I'm not sure if it's do-able or not:   ""One strategy for us would be to make sure that there is a single title and creator element designated as ""main"" (or similar) by attribute for use in these situations.  A simpler approach, if it is possible, would be to make new solr fields, e.g. ""sort_title"", ""sort_creator"", and populate them with an xpath statement that only gets the first instance of each from the metadata. For example, the xpath for the general title field is:  /mods/titleInfo/title but to ensure we only get a single value for a ""sort_title"" field, we could modify that to:  /mods/titleInfo/title0 ...and do the same for creator. Thoughts on that approach?""",Solr Search,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
ISLANDORA-538,Stats/ Reporting functions for IR (scholar module) ,"I heard there's a new statistics module that's working with the scholar module (with Google analytics). A DGI client would like something similar. Not sure if it needs to be generalized or if it's good to go.   Also, clients have requested per item statistics (in an IR). UPEI is doing it in beta. See description below of how they're doing it:   ""The current reporting function for the IR module exists as a submodule within the IR code but works independently, I've just not had the time to separate it into its own repo. It's also designed specifically for the IR module and so I didn't want to give people the wrong idea by presenting it as a standalone module. At the moment the module records every citation view and every datastream download from the citation view in the database. When a citation is viewed a piece of code writes the details to a database table, recording the pid and time that it was accessed. I wrote an intermediate page for the datastream download which is transparent to the user but also records when the datastream is accessed and the pid associated with it. The module allows for certain IPs to be ignored when collecting data so that developers testing the site don't artificially increase the hits on any of the content. There is also the option to clear the counts for certain pids or for the whole site. The main focus of this functionality was to give the users of the site some idea of how popular it was and so convince people that it's worthwhile participating in. While we wanted to be able to display the statistics for a specific object we also wanted to report site-wide statistics such as number of citations viewed or number of full-text articles downloaded. This was the main reason that I chose to store the information in the database rather than in a datastream associated with each object. While the datastream solution would allow for the reporting of statistics on an individual object it would be very time consuming to get a report on all of the objects in the site. That would involve reading the datastream for every object and adding together the number of times each object had been viewed. This is something that would have to be done an a periodic basis (daily) whereas a database query can be done on-the-fly to give the user up-to-date statistics.""

Basically, despite sending accurate credentials in the GET request, the fedoraRole is not recognized by fedora's AttributeFinderModule, and a user cannot access a particular datastream. The protected datastreams, however, are viewable in Fedora's admin console (while using the same credentials) since that uses the REST API.

ISLANDORA-550,UX and theming improvements,"This is a general ticket to address 2 issues. I'm assuming that these 2 issues aren't new to anyone, so they might be more of a reminder.  1) The lack of drupal theme layer integration. All markup from modules should be rendered through theme functions or template files. I would suggest checking core drupal theme functions in the drupal API overview, so these are not repeated. A few that are used often are theme_table() (<table>) and theme_item_list() (<ul>). I know many of us want to take this into consideration, but often we have a lot of time pressure on our projects so it's easy to overlook these 'details'. For core Islandora modules (anything hosted on the Islandora Github account), there shouldn't be any excuse though.  2) The lack of well thought out UX in islandora. The user interface of islandora is often very confusing or just plain wrong from a UX standpoint. I don't often manage objects, but I took a look today and it's pretty bad. (To modify or delete datastreams you have to navigate to the 'view' tab instead of the 'edit' tab ??) This might not be important from a developer's perspective, but really if you look at the total picture of the project this is like having a bunch of recoverable fatal errors in your code and do nothing about it.  I don't have any straight answers for these issues (yet), but I think it's a good idea not to accept any pull requests anymore with markup that's not rendered through the theme layer.

ISLANDORA-578,Query Parsing in islandora_solr_search,"Islandora Solr folks,  I believe there's a fairly important bug in the islandora_solr_search module (at least as of 11.3.1) that involves all multi-term Advanced Search queries.  In a nutshell, when in Islandora Solr Advanced Search, you pick a field called ""subject"" and type in ""United States"", the module builds a solr query like this:  q=subject:United States  Solr percieves the ""Statues"" as unattached, and breaks this down to  subject:united \ [default_field]:states.  Solr identifies a default field I believe from the Request Handler. In one project I'm currently helping with, Solr's default field is dc.description.  So when I explicitly select the Subject box in Advanced Search and enter, say, United States Steel Corporation, what Solr ends up with is:  subject:united \ dc.description:states \ dc.description:steel \ dc.description:corporation  i.e. the majority of my field-specific query is happening against the wrong field.  The solution is to wrap search terms in parentheses before executing a query, like this:  q=subject:(United States)  which Solr knows to break down to:  subject:united \ subject:states  Parenthesis wrapping won't affect quoted strings.  That is to say:  q=subject:(""United States"")  will break down to  subject:""united states""  i.e. not at all.  (Note: There is an implied OR between all search terms, and I'm not showing the tokenization that happens against text fields.)  I remember discovering this some time ago, and I really thought I'd incorporated a fix, but that would have been pre-git and I don't have a record of it.  Outwardly it seems that the islandora_solr_search implementation on islandlives.ca does correctly wrap solr search terms in parentheses, which suggests to me that a fix might have been un-fixed at some point in the past year or so.",Solr Search,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

ISLANDORA-612,XACML Editor should provide descriptive messages when user tries to perform a prohibited action,"In some cases a user without permission to perform certain actions (based on XACML policies) will still see those actions as options on their screen due to Drupal permissions.

However, when they try to save any changes made on the editor screen it fails (correctly) due to XACML policy enforcement.  This is all working as intended, but when such an action fails the user gets a generic Fedora error message (can't modify Datastream, etc.) instead of a relevant message about XACML permissions.

It would be convenient to be able to get all the DSID's of an object by doing something like.  array_keys($object->datastreams); or array_keys($object);  or to utilize the array_map, and array_walk functions. http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.array.php  We need discuss and think carefully before adding something like as $datastreams is currently protected and managed by the object, and I don't think it would be a good idea to expose it publicly.

For better IR-like functionality, would be very helpful to be able to grant users other CRUD permissions on objects/datastreams which they've deposited. I don't believe this should be too difficult as the only ""hook"" that's theoretically required is the Fedora ""Owner"" property on a given object, which appears to be functioning as it should (e.g. line 108 in https://github.com/Islandora/islandora_scholar/blob/7.x/modules/islandora_scholar_embargo/islandora_scholar_embargo.module).  For reference, please see http://lib-hf1.lib.sfu.ca/islandoraperm.png -- notice that ""Manage embargo on own objects"" near the bottom is the only such permission that can be applied to only a user's own objects; ideally, editing metadata, replacing or reverting datastreams, and removing objects would also have a separate ""only own objects"" permission to be granted to authenticated users. As it is, we've effectively only been able to grant the CR- permissions and not the -UD ones to authenticated users because this distinction isn't respected.","Islandora Module (Core),Scholar Module",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The first and I think it would be preferred is to add a Tab with a + symbol. That is a common interface pattern (eg. in browser interfaces) for adding another tab - the user selects the tab with + symbol and a new tab panel is generated. The other is to simply change to wording on the button to something that explicitly references the action - New Tab.

It would also be useful to index or push to RELS-EXT the results of a checksum check ... then an admin could run a Solr or ITQL query to return any checksum operations that failed and then act on them.  [~markj] Respoded:  I like this feature a lot, but have to ask how crowded this display would become if both the vault and checksum checker modules were enabled. Also, WRT querying RELS-EXT, the fixity checks generate a lot of data; if we were to update RELS-EXT, I'd like to think of ways of not recording every check but instead just the results of the latest check, or something like that. Another approach might be to store results of fixity checks in a database table and then use Views to provide a UI to the data.  I agree that being able to query for mismatches is an important feature. Let's use this issue to brainstorm this a bit before we write any code.  Also, currently, admins get an email if Checksum Checker detects a fixity mismatch.  And [~ppound] responded to that:  The vault code was written against a very early version of islandora version 7 so there maybe better ways to modify the datastreams table now? Vault does it in a preprocessor not sure if we now have hooks to enable this or not.

ISLANDORA-1086,Utilize defined temporary directory for temporary file operations on serialized bags to reduce unnecessary storage allocation on versioned filesystems,"If the output directory for serialized bags is a versioned filesystem, islandora_bagit creates unnecessary versions while conducting temporary file operations.  If using existing 'Temporary directory for unserialized Bags' path is undesirable, I suggest a new 'Temporary directory for serialized Bags' setting, or just employ one temporary work directory setting for both kinds of bags and be done with it.  Regardless, the desired effect is: conduct temporary file operations related to serialized bags in well defined temporary path, then write final output to defined serialized bag output directory.  Subsequently, when 'Create Bag on object modification' setting is employed, bag modification temporary tasks should also be conducted in defined temporary path, not final output path, again to reduce unnecessary versions when using a versioned filesystem.

We thought we could just hide this print icon but it turns out to be part of the Islandora core stack, and we don't want to make any changes to it b/c of that.  We also thought that maybe in place of the print icon we could have a tab that says ""Details"" on it.

ISLANDORA-1224,Replace TN datastream function requires PNG while system generates JPG,"One part of the system generates JPG thumbnails, but another part of the system only accepts PNG thumbnails, when replacing TN datastreams.    This behavior presents a logic problem for me, so I'm filing it the in hopes of commiseration from others.    The issue effectively thwarts reuse of existing object's JPG thumbnails as a drop-in replacement for collection folder thumbnails.      Currently, to route around the issue, one must download an object's JPG thumbnail, open it in a graphics program and save it as a PNG for the system to accept it as a TN datastream replacement; a completely unnecessary workflow in my honest opinion.    If the consensus can be achieved that PNG is the preference, maybe the system should generate PNG thumbnail derivatives instead of JPG.  That way, one could reuse PNG thumbnails for collection thumbnail replacement.       Today, one part of the system generates JPG, while another part of the system forbids JPG.

I started to work on it then I was turned onto:    https://github.com/discoverygarden/islandora_collection_search    That DGI module already does everything and then some =) However, that left me with some questions. Does the DGI module necessarily preclude an implementation directly in islandora_solr_search? Is the functionality not generally useful enough anyway to be included in ""core"" and not require an external, non-Foundation dependency or custom implementation?    So, two things:    1. Is there value in a feature request for a collections dropdown in the advanced search block of islandora_solr_search? Is that something that would add value to the community as part of that module? If no, then please feel free to close this ticket and look no further =)    2. If yes, then here is what I came up with so far:    https://github.com/Islandora/islandora_solr_search/compare/7.x...mark-cooper:adv_srch_coll    Which makes the functionality optional. A key implementation issue is of course descendant object relationships and there is handling for that, but not for page content model objects without some indexing / reindexing assistance (which the DGI module appears to do with bonus gsearch integration [I haven't tried to use it], but would otherwise be up to the implementer here).    So perhaps the approach is too naive / compromised? I'm a newbie to the Islandora code so won't be upset at all by that judgement -- for example I'm not clear if it's even conventionally acceptable to include basic_collection in solr_search as I've done.

ISLANDORA-1234,Create Bag on object modification loop possibly caused by users who rarely logout,"Observed in dblog a bag being generated over and over again; the same bag was being generated practically every minute for over 24 hours.    I was working on batch cleanup issues during this same timeframe and had cleared data from the batch tables.  I believe the clearing of batch data effectively eliminated batch as the source of the issue.    Started reviewing islandora_bagit.module code to increase understanding, and landed on:    function islandora_bagit_create_bag_on_shutdown() {    if (isset($_SESSION['islandora_object'])) {      islandora_bagit_create_bag($_SESSION['islandora_object']);      // Clear this variable in the session so the Bag isn't generated again.      unset($_SESSION['islandora_object']);    }  }    Examined my drupal's session table, examining each of the session's BLOBs, and found a session containing references to ""islandora_bagit"".    I deleted the session in question, which is attached to this issue.  Sure enough, the bag in question stopped generating in the observed looped fashion.    Putting two and two together, I realized function islandora_bagit_create_bag_on_shutdown() is supposed to run on logout, but I had not actually logged out.  I had just shut my laptop and went home, came back in the next day and picked up where I left off, all without logging out and in again.  Typical behavior...    After observing the same bag being generated at a frequency of practically every minute for over 24 hours, I believe it's possible for a bagit loop to happen, due to the user not logging out and possibly due to factors with the data stored in the session.    I examined the offending object's foxml in the objectStore and it's datastreams, and the files were not being updated in the continuous manner that should logically trigger an object modification event; I don't believe the file's last modified dates were a factor in triggering the bagit loop.    I suspected checksum checking and PREMIS events to be triggering the export event, due to audit stream updating, but my research proved that was not the case.    I believe the key is the user wasn't logging out, which of course did not trigger unset($_SESSION['islandora_object']);    The export loop kept looping in a odd way however, which may have something to do with the session data technique/methodology.    For the object in question, I certainly do have an odd number of revisions on RELS-EXT and POLICY datastreams; maybe an errant XACML function is polluting the waters of understanding...  I certainly did not manually update RELS-EXT 30 times, nor POLICY 15 times...

ISLANDORA-1279,Proposal for Autocomplete framework,"It would be really useful to be able to configure your own autocomplete callbacks.    I think there ought to be a more general autocomplete framework in Islandora core that modules currently implementing their own autocomplete (such as Entities) can hook into. I think you should be able to specify what field to search, and what field to return (e.g. search on label, but return pid), and specify any filters (e.g. search only objects with islandora:collectionCModel).     Here's what I think we could do with it.  https://roblib.mybalsamiq.com/projects/bowingdownhome/prototype/Islandora%20Autocomplete%20Mockup?key=36aa3868b79b2357b4e91f44f70672b4de81fa34    This could totally be done as a code thing, using an API or hooks. But for bonus points, I think it's be super cool to have a config screen where a (clever) admin could configure their own autocompletes. Any of this would require a bit of documentation, about what field types are good for autocomplete (text, not string), and huge warnings that if you search on A and return B you'd better make sure that A is sufficiently disambiguated. <rant />    As mentioned by Will P on the call, DGI's islandora_authority also implements an autocomplete, but if I understand it correctly it populates several elements of a form (such as the associated 'uri' attribute in a mods tag while you autocomplete on the value), and must be processed through Objective Forms.

The issue is probably caused by an incorrect form element, but determining which element to blame is very difficult, especially when the looping behavior is grinding the client-side into the ground...    It would be nice to determine the cause, so the module could be modified to defend or prevent looping errors.  The client-side program also needs the ability to point out precisely which element is causing an error.    There are also other examples where an element error is happening, but the archivist building the form isn't presented any helpful information to find the source of the error, because the client-side doesn't communicate errors effectively and the Watchdog error message is ambiguous:    Recoverable fatal error: Argument 3 passed to Create::append() must be an instance of DOMElement, instance of DOMText given, called in /path/sites/all/modules/islandora_xml_forms/api/Create.inc on line 168 and defined in Create->append() (line 307 of /path/sites/all/modules/islandora_xml_forms/api/Create.inc).

ISLANDORA-1362,[UIIG] File upload during ingest should be optional.,"From the UI Interest group (July 22), we discussed the use cases in which people would want to make ""skeleton"" metadata-only objects even though the digitized files weren't available yet. However, it's been customary to make the file upload mandatory.     Fix would require going through all modules' includes/[file]_upload.form.inc and removing the ""#required"" => TRUE line from the form definition, then checking whether a file is present in the submit handler.    This functionality already exists in the batch uploader, i.e. you can bulk-create objects from only XML files, so that's a way to have the same effect. But it's somewhat clumsy because you have to create and save the XML to disk first.     I'm curious to know the reasoning for which the file upload was originally made mandatory, if that can shed some light on whether we should do this.","Audio Solution Pack,Basic Image Solution Pack,Disk Image Solution Pack,Large Image Solution Pack,PDF Solution Pack,Video Solution Pack,Web ARChive Solution Pack",0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

ISLANDORA-1372,Searching Pagination,"Hello,    I've identified a bug in the Book Solution Pack (actually, could be any ingestion if my guess is correct).  Attached are two images of searches demonstrating the correct and incorrect behavior.  Currently, both searches identify the documents AND pages where the search term exists, and the search results properly display the page.  However, in the ""not working"" image you'll notice that while the correct page was clicked in search results, the viewer pulls up the document at the first page (I simply scrolled to that page to illustrate that the term-highlighting did not happen).  You'll also notice that the orange pin is off the left (if you hover, it says page 0).      The RELS-EXT XML file that was created as part of the ingestion process set the Sequence and Page numbers as strings, but it seems integers are required.  Here s an example:         <islandora:isSequenceNumber>page-01</islandora:isSequenceNumber>      <islandora:isPageNumber>page-01</islandora:isPageNumber>     These should be:         <islandora:isSequenceNumber>01</islandora:isSequenceNumber>      <islandora:isPageNumber>01</islandora:isPageNumber>     Those were labeled after the name the directory was called before being ingested.  Unfortunately, you cannot edit the RELS-EXT file.      Since everything else works fine, I think that either an error should not accept and send an error (or, rather, cleanse the field to just an integer) as a part of the ingestion process.  Of course, having the search simply accept and handle ""page-01"" would also work, but it seems cleaning the data would be preferable.     Thank you!

ISLANDORA-1388,Facet Page searches don't honor default query namespace,"When one clicks a link to perform a search of a MODS element on a Solr Facets Page, say, for all ""Authors"", the search it performs does not restrict the results to the namespace specified in ""Limit results to specific namespaces"" in the ""Query Defaults"" section of ""Solr Setting"" and thus the result set lists hits from the entire repository instead. I think the default behavior should be for Faces Page searches to honor the specified namespace -- otherwise it is going to show hits outside of that namespace.    Strangely enough, when one clicks on one of those hits in the results set, the search performed DOES honor the specified namespace (which, of course, restricts the search much more), and thus will result in no hits if not found in objects of that namespace.    The solution would be to require the Facets Page searches to honor the ""Limit results to specific namespaces"" setting at all times.",Solr Facet Pages,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Despite the fact that the dropdown list displays for thesis objects as well, choosing a new citation style does nothing.    After some digging, it looks like the access callback function is hardcoded to only work for citation objects.

ISLANDORA-1414,islandora_xml_forms: Drupal 7.39 breaks autocomplete functionality,"NOTE: I have created a pull request for this: https://github.com/Islandora/islandora_xml_forms/pull/195    Drupal 7.39 came out on August 19, 2015 -- a security release. One of the vulnerabilities it was patching was autocomplete, which was open to cross-site scripting (SA-CORE-2015-003). A new function was introduced (form_process_autocomplete) to ""sufficiently sanitize"" requested URLs. Autocomplete broke for many modules after upgrading to Drupal 7.39 -- including islandora_xml_forms. This is because the function form_process_autocomplete() is now required as part of an element's ""#process"" array.    For islandora_xml_forms, this problem only appears to impact autocomplete fields where multiple values can be added. Single-item autocomplete fields seem unaffected by the upgrade.    Autocomplete (under Drupal 7.39) also seems to have a problem with field IDs with numbers in them. The module islandora_xml_forms has been overriding the element ID (which is usually based on the field name: example: formSections[subjects][topic] becomes edit-formsections-subjects-topic) and replacing it with a hash instead (00000000682de34e000000015b767354).

ISLANDORA-1437,Solution packs for non-visual items should refer to a 'default' TN rather than creating a datastream.,"When the TN isn't derived from the OBJ, we're wasting storage by adding the ""folder icon"" default thumbnail to every object as a TN datastream. Instead,    - each solution pack should come with a default thumbnail for each content model it defines (as is currently the case)   - these defaults should be configurable by content model in the admin interface (so they can be updated/replaced)  - TN datastreams should not be added to new objects by default. Users should be given an option to upload a TN of their choosing in the ingest steps. Users can add/replace the TN of an existing object (as is currently the case)  - if the TN datastream is not available, the display should use the configured default image for that object's content type.   - the Regenerate Derivatives call should not change user-uploaded TNs.    Warning: it's been customary to use islandora/object/PID/datastream/TN/view in many places, such as Views and Solr search results (and more generally, any time an Islandora object is displayed or referred to it's assumed that it has a TN datastream). If we do what's suggested above, these would break. I think it would be desirable for this Drupal path to resolve to the default TN if the datastream is not present. I'd be tempted to change how Islandora's menu callbacks behave, but am wary of making what is essentially a change to Islandora's API.    Split off from ISLANDORA-1096.

(Rosie's note: it would be much nicer to have used the isDerivativeOf relation in the RELS-INT from the get-go, and describe which datastreams were automatically generated rather than which were custom uploaded, but it would be impossible to implement this now with any degree of backwards-compatibility.)     Use cases (from the listserv discussion above):   - custom TNs shouldn't be overwritten with the generic default.

ISLANDORA-1452,"""Create Bag on object modification"" ideas for performance improvements","""Create Bag on object modification"" is an ironclad method for ensuring preservation of objects, but it is resource intensive.    For example, if one edits the metadata of an object, Create bag on object modification is triggered.  If that object is a large object, say a 4GB WAV object, then a simple metadata edit triggers a 4GB bag export and hangs the web browser until completion.    Instead of holding the web browser hostage, maybe Create bag on object modification can be deferred.  What's truly important is not to lose record of the modification action, so a freshened bag may be produced at some time.  It's when the bag is produced that's an issue, due to the web browser hanging on while the bag is generated.    Using a deferred strategy, bag production could be started via drush at the best time of the day determined by the systems administrator, ex: after everyone has gone home for the day.    A deferred strategy could also solve another related issue, multiple edits on an object per day.   Today, with each metadata edit, a freshened bag is created.  If multiple metadata edits happen to the same object during the same day, the bag will be generated multiple times per day.   If deferred, the bag could possibly be generated only once, just based upon the last record of modification.    Regardless, bag generation should be backgrounded, letting go of the web browser so the employee can continue on with their workday, instead of having to hang on and wait for a large object bag to be produced.

ISLANDORA-1475,Limit the use of Inline datastreams.,Due to the cyclical efficiency gains in ingest scripts coupled with broad and aging hardware platforms we are experiencing degenerative processing capability that results in break scenarios for rapid batch ingests (commonly known as 409 errors).  This is causing operation adversity that can be alleviated by moving from inline to managed datastreams.    This is a continuation of https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/ISLANDORA-675 .   Instead of just targeting metadata datastreams we should target all inline datastreams.    The specific trouble is that Fedora runs into write locks with the FOXML and 409s under heavy load. Heavy load is determined both by how much work Fedora is being asked to do (both on a FOXML and system level) and the hardware it has available to do it. This most often has catastrophic consequences for rapid batch ingests but in some cases impacts front end single object ingests.,Tuque API,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

ISLANDORA-1478,Audio Solution pack without LAME installed,"This enhancement is for work that has already been produced. If the design is not desirable by the solution pack owners, we will redesign and reimplement as they see fit. The goal is to contribute code that solves the issue below.    Currently the audio solution pack requires that LAME is installed. The main issue faced by someone trying to use the solution pack without LAME is that the drupal hook_requirements method of the solution pack uses REQUIREMENT_WARNING which will not allow normal operation of drupal's update.php to update the database - requiring an override. The minor issue is that messages are sent to the watchdog log on every audio ingest.    In this case, someone is not able to install LAME on the Drupal server, but is able to generate the PROXY_MP3 as a derivative to store in Fedora. The desired result is that the Drupal administrator should be able to install the module, use update.php, and the user would be able to use the player that the solution pack uses.    This work has already been done in the following way, but my customer (Smithsonian Institution) is open to redesign and rework by the company I work for:  islandora_audio.module:    included a string constant to indicate that the LAME encoder should not be run  if executable path is set to this string value, no attempt to run LAME or message to the watchdog log on audio ingest includes/admin.form.inc:  include text on form for what should be used in the field that points to the executable to indicate LAME is not installed islandora_audio.install:  if the executable path is set to the string constant, issue REQUIREMENT_INFO as severity instead of REQUIREMENT_WARNING",Audio Solution Pack,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

All existing cmodels are being removed and replaced by one (the associated to the form used to make the editing) braking the ability to have multiple cmodels in an Object and in specific Entities solution pack behaviour.    Since the pull request that originated this behaviour doesn't has a JIRA ticket it would be pertinent to investigate if there could be other places where this new behaviour could break existing functionality.    I made this a blocker because it breaks and/or changes behaviour of already working modules.    Also, it's not clear if we should fix this on the xml_forms side?

ISLANDORA-1533,Ability to hide page objects from Solr search results,"Currently, the behaviour of Islandora Solr is to display every page object found in a result set as part of the search results. This can be considered undesirable, as often hundreds or thousands of pages can show up in a result set thanks to individual page OCR and other metadata, obfuscating more useful results.    The purpose of this ticket is to:    1) Make it possible to filter page objects from Solr results queries in a simple manner similar to the Islandora Compound Solr filtering query,  2) Make it possible to store consolidated OCR at the book level so OCR search isn't interrupted by this,  3) Provide ways of consolidating the OCR during batch ingest (drush and interface),  4) Provide a way of updating that consolidated OCR if necessary, and  5) Provide a Drush method for updating the OCR of existing objects for sites that wish to use this feature.    --Use Case--  - Sites that store a great deal of books with high volumes of pages may want to be able to only show paged content objects in Solr search results, and not the pages themselves.  - Sites that wish to use this feature may want to update existing paged content objects to this method as well.    --Technical Approach--  The biggest problem here is figuring out how to make sure that OCR can be searched even if page objects are being filtered out. Ideally we don't want to do this in a way that has to read individual OCR datastreams from page objects out of Fedora (e.g., after ingest or during the index process).    The least intensive way of doing this seems to be to attach consolidated OCR datastreams to book objects while the pages are being made by maintaining a consolidated OCR file and appending individual page OCR files to it as they are made. We have precedent for this; it's how aggregated PDFs are currently done.    --Test Case--  This touches a lot of parts of the Paged Content functionality, so any part of Paged Content that creates or creates, updates, or otherwise uses OCR should be checked. We should also check that this doesn't impact existing or new sites that don't want to use this functionality.    --Impact--  Because this will bake functionality into batch ingest (Drush and interface) and into the OCR regeneration, we should ensure that, whenever possible, existing functionality can be maintained - in short, we shouldn't be forcing anyone to append OCR to paged content objects, and the default behaviour should maintain current behaviour.    ----  QA Dan  Developer  discoverygarden inc. | Managing Digital Content","Book Batch,Book Solution Pack,Newspaper Batch,Newspaper Solution Pack,OCR,Paged Content,Solr Search",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

If so, it's supposed to skip adding the new value.    However, the code does not do this. It loops through the existing values at that tool/field, and if **any** of them do not match the current value, it will add the current value:                  foreach ($output[$tool_label][$field_label] as $key => $value) {                    if ($value !== $output_text) {                      $output[$tool_label][$field_label][] = $output_text;                    }                  }  I think a more correct approach would be something like the following:                  if (!in_array($output_text, $output[$tool_label][$field_label])) {                    $output[$tool_label][$field_label][] = $output_text;                  }  ",FITS module,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This is a toggleable feature because it exposes an advanced option to the end user that may lead to unexpected results if not used incorrectly. By default, pdftotext extracts text in natural reading order. In edge case documents, where PDF creation tools have made blocks in errorneous order, text extraction will yield unexpected results. As such, this parameter will pull out text in the order that the PDF creation tool wrote it (layout ignored). This is not a valid default option to have due to that PDF creation tools are not constrained to writing blocks in the order they appear and it is up to the PDF reader to render them correctly.    --Technical Approach--  Add an optional parameter to the utility function that calls pdftotext that defaults to the old behavior of FALSE/not including the flag to pdftotext.    --Test Case--  Enable the toggleable checkbox to expose this feature through the paged content admin page located at yoursite/admin/islandora/solution_pack_config/paged_content  Go through the ingest process for a book or newspaper issue object.

ISLANDORA-1544,PDF creation flags don't get removed from paged content batches,"The offending code is right here:    https://github.com/Islandora/islandora_paged_content/blob/7.x/includes/derivatives.inc#L125    That batch op calls islandora_book_batch_remove_pdf_flag, which is a function that doesn't exist.    This means that the create_pdf flag is not getting removed from paged content batch objects.    I'm recommending a few things here:    1) This function name should be fixed to the actual function name, islandora_paged_content_remove_pdf_flag().  2) In addition, it should not be an extra batch operation, as that just makes it difficult to ensure includes/derivatives.inc is actually loaded when the function is called. Since all islandora_paged_content_remove_pdf_flag() is doing is calling out to $object->relationships->remove(), which doesn't explode if it doesn't find the flag (it just returns FALSE), we could very easily just move it to here somewhere as just a straight call to the function: https://github.com/Islandora/islandora_paged_content/blob/7.x/includes/batch.inc#L192-195 - I've actually implemented it thusly for the OCR stuff: https://github.com/qadan/islandora_paged_content/blob/7.x-ISLANDORA-1533/includes/batch.inc#L299  3) This has likely borked a lot of paged content objects on a lot of boxes. We will need to come up with a drush method to clean up offending RELS-EXTs in existing installs.    --Steps to Reproduce--  Batch ingest a book or issue using the book or issue batch ingest process (drush or GUI). A 'create_pdf' relationship will be left over in the RELS-EXT of the paged content object (the book or issue itself).    --Test Case--  Batch ingest a book or issue using the book or issue batch ingest process (drush or GUI). There should be no 'create_pdf' relationship in the RELS-EXT of the paged content object (the book or issue itself).

ISLANDORA-1547,Add hook_islandora_edit_datastream_registry_alter to modify the datastream edit registry after it has been built by hook_islandora_edit_datastream_registry,"Inside of islandora_edit_datastream create an drupal_alter after the edit registry is built to allow for modifications to the $edit_registry variable before it is rendered.    This allows for other module(s) to have more control over what is stored/rendered from the built $edit_registry variable.    https://github.com/Islandora/islandora/blob/7.x/includes/datastream.inc#L296-L298    --Use Case--    Site wants to replace the xml_form_builder_islandora_edit_datastream_registry with a custom edit registry so that the new registry is the only one that exists.

ISLANDORA-1549,Audio SP: optionally defer to the OBJ datastream if PROXY_MP3 is absent,"The Audio SP assumes that a PROXY_MP3 derivative _needs_ to be generated for JWPlayer, but this isn't the case for all repositories. In cases where the original OBJ uploaded to the repository is perfectly fine for playing in the JWPlayer, deriving and storing a PROXY_MP3 represents unnecessary space and computation power being used up server-side.    We should make it so that, optionally, the Audio SP will attempt to load the OBJ into the player if the PROXY_MP3 isn't present.    Addendum: I say 'JWPlayer' a lot here, but realistically, the only important thing is mime type; JWPlayer uses the native abilities of the browser to play audio files, so as long as it can be played in JWPlayer, it should also be able to be played in other players, should one make the switch away from JWPlayer in the future.    --Use Case--  Instead of raw, uncompressed archival audio files like WAVs, the audio files an institution wishes to deposit are already compressed MP3s that are suitable for playing by an end user in the JWPlayer.    In this case, compressing a second PROXY_MP3 wastes computation time and energy, and storing it wastes server space and creates unnecessary additional relationships in Fedora.    --Technical Approach--  On the user end, this will involve checking off an option in the admin form to allow fallback to OBJ files.    On the back end, this would involve determining the status of that option, as well as determining whether or not the OBJ is suitable for playback (e.g., looking at the mimetype).    --Test Case--  This should be tested against a bunch of differently-constructed MP3 files. Currently, we run all audio through LAME, which means that we kind of curate the makeup of MP3 files that get sent to the player. We should try to make sure that the solution in place to determine whether or not an OBJ is playable is suitable.    This should also be tested across all popular browsers, including mobile.    --Impact--  If what is mentioned in the test case isn't thoroughly tested, we could be sending unsuitable files off to the player, which could result in any number of things ending in a poor user experience.    ----  QA Dan  Developer  discoverygarden inc. | Managing Digital Content","Audio Solution Pack,JWPlayer",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The documentation needs to be updated to reflect the update to $id.  Seems to make sense to update the variable name within the function itself to reflect the change as well. It's important that this function update needs to be able to work without impacting the current method of passing in the CrossRef ID. The description of the doi_populator field should also be updated to to include new examples of full DOI URLs.       --Test Case--  Create an object using the DOI importer using the following DOI format:  http://doi.org/10.1111/eva.12339  http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eva.12339  doi:10.1111/eva.12339  10.1111/eva.12339  * any of the variants above with extra whitespace in the beginning or end of string.      --Impact--  There should be no impact on the current DOI use case so that it maintains backwards compatibility allowing for the original formats (doi:10.1111/eva.12339 or 10.1111/eva.12339) to continue to work as intended.    ----  Matthew Perry  Developer  discoverygarden inc. | Managing Digital Content,Scholar Module,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
ISLANDORA-1556,Fedora is unreliable under heavy concurrency on single objects.,"To mitigate the issues with Fedora being unreliable under heavy concurrency on single objects we can eliminate that concurrency.    --Use Case--    This is a general race condition:  Two processes modifying the same object can run across inconsistent errors from Fedora depending on specific operations being performed, how long into the operations the two Fedora threads are and (suspected)Fedora version.    The specific case prompting this improvement is multiprocess derivative generation via islandora_job https://github.com/discoverygarden/islandora_job      --Technical Approach--    Block low level APIM using semaphores.  Use Drupal semaphores as they have great power for Islandora both in Drush and multi-sites and is a proven system.  Make the semaphores toggleable (off by default) because this feature is unnecessary for light use of Islandora.  Make the time a semaphore can be reserved for configurable as this is not a one size fits all.      --Test Case--    This is a race condition relying on the state of more than one system. It is difficult to test and errors will be intermittent.  This race condition theoretically needs at least 2 processors and has been tested on a machine with 3.    Ways to test:  * Manual: Open several tabs on the same object and regenerate its derivatives in all of them. This is the least likely option to cause the collision.  * Script: Write a script that forks PHP where one process ingests a book and the other ingests the first page in that book with a TN DS. Loop this in the shell for increased chance of collision.  * islandora_job: Setup islandora_job with at least two gearman processes.  Ingest a one page book with minimal DSs and a small TN using islandora_book_batch. Loop this in the shell for increased chance of collision.    From the user's perspective it is very difficult to prove success on intermittent issues.  I suggest the use of a debugger to analyse the code paths.      --Impact--    There is negative impact from both increased admin complexity and performance penalty on inadvertent activation of the feature.  The increased admin complexity can be mitigated as much as possible via Drupal states.  The risk of inadvertent activation can be mitigated through documentation in the admin screen detailing the cost/benefit trade off and intended use case.      ----  William Panting  Developer  discoverygarden inc. | Managing Digital Content",Islandora Module (Core),0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Using the triggering element parents it can get the proper element within the empty form to use in processing the default values.  The closure function to set the default value to NULL needs to be updated to accept the empty form element as an additional parameter and using the current element index it can find the #default_value and use that.          --Test Case--  Requirements: Form builder form with tabpanel that has a field within it that has a default value set.    Example 1:     Default - Collection MODS Form  Within this form the name (tabs) -> 0 (tabpanel) -> type (select) has the default value set of personal.    The first tab when you load the form uses the correct default but as soon as you add a new tab the newly cloned tab will default to corporate as this is the first option in the select box.     With this change when you add the new tab it will load the default value of the initial ""empty/new"" form and set the select option to personal.    Example 2:    Make a form with a tab panel and set a default value on a field.  When adding a new tab it should always prepopulate with the default value set for that field.

ISLANDORA-1567,Islandora's Admin Form is Confusing,"Improve the Islandora Admin Configuration form (at admin/islandora/configure).     We've been adding options as we needed more config variables without any thought to logical presentation, and the form has become a mix of required, sometimes-used, and special-case options. The default values are not stated in the interface, and there is no way to ""reset to defaults"". Additionally, the verbiage used to describe the options has not been consistent either in terms of sense (e.g.  positive ""show print option"" vs. negative ""defer derivatives"") or voice (e.g. ""Use iTQL"" vs. ""UUID PID Generation"").    All of this makes it difficult for a new admin to understand the options they are presented with, and this seems like it's only going to get worse as more flexibility is added.     This was discussed in #1535 [warning: the comments section is book-length], and to quote [~ddavis], ""I would think a good admin GUI separates out the required, optional but common, and advanced. This gives the admin a gradual on-ramp.""    Rosie's editorial note: part of the reason for this ticket is that I don't think the argument that ""having that option available will confuse some users"" should be used to prevent a feature from being merged, as in #1535 (where it was) and in #1556 (where it wasn't). Not if there's a use case where it could improve some repositories.

ISLANDORA-1588,Add sorting to the Solr collection display query backend,"Bit of an inconsistency between the SPARQL and Solr collection display backends - the SPARQL backend uses an ORDER BY to sort the results, whereas the Solr backend just goes by the default Solr sort, whatever that may be.    This isn't really optimal; it means that in order to get an alphabetical (or alphanumerical or what have you) sort into the collection display, you're forcing Solr searches to be alphanumerical as well. Otherwise, your collection display winds up being score-based. It's not a great choice to have to make.    What's more, the way one collection is sorted may not make sense for a separate collection with different metadata that's indexed in a different way.    I'd like to set up the Solr collection display backend to run sorting like this:  * Use a collection-specific sort string if available  * If none is available, use the default collection display backend sort string.  * If that isn't set either, use the default Solr sort.    --Use Case--  An institution would like to use the Solr collection display backend, but would also like to sort their collections alphabetically, or alphanumerically, or by some other scheme, rather than in the same way search results are sorted, without impacting the way search results are sorted.    --Technical Approach--  A slight modification to the existing solr collection display backend would have to be added to include a default sort string, if that's what's wanted.    We should find a way as well to add this to the collection level, e.g, using a relationship on the collection that defines the sort string.    --Test Case--  Switch to the Solr collection display backend for collection queries.

ISLANDORA-1600,Create a module that allows swapping out queries via hooks,"Currently, SPARQL queries are hard-coded into Islandora in several places throughout various modules to provide things like lists of objects. This hard-ties us to several things - most importantly driving a huge chunk of the site display through the triplestore.    The work done as part of this ticket should accomplish two things:    1. Create a module to provide a user interface and hooks to allow for swapping individual queries out. The module should provide a hook to register queries available for implementation and report them to the user interface; this hook should describe the registered query's required variables and return values. The module should also provide a hook to allow modules to implement registered queries; this second hook should accept anything necessary to trigger a query callback (e.g., file location, callable, etc). The api.php should also describe how a sample callback function may look.    2. Wrap existing queries in a module_exists() call to check for this new module. If the module is enabled, default querying behaviour should be swapped out for results provided by callbacks defined by the query registry.    Doing all of this will provide a simple, integrated interface for managing queries, which should be a marked improvement over the current query management style where query management is either handled in multiple places or is not handled at all due to hard-coding    This ticket does not deal with actually implementing any of the new queries, only to provide the ability for them to be implemented. Once we have this ticket completed and have examples of the hooks in use, we can then set about implementing as many of the queries as we can so we can start to move away from driving the site display using Mulgara.    This will require extensive testing; any queries that are affected by this should be checked to see if existing functionality remains when the module is not installed, and that query-swapping functions correctly if it is. Queries affected should be documented so that this testing can take place.","Islandora Module (Core),Solr Search",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

FSU has several staff at the graduate school who need to be able to manage embargoes independently on ETDs. We created a low-power ""embargo_admin"" role with just these permissions, but even with the proper permissions assigned they were still unable to access items with an object-level embargo.    I have submitted a pull request with the code we added to the module at FLVC. It does a check for all all roles with the ""can embargo any object"" permission and adds that role to the XACML policy.

Solution (pull to come) is:     `if ($compound_info) {          drupal_set_title(t('@parent - @child', array(            '@parent' => $compound_info['parent_label'],            '@child' => $compound_info['label'],          )), PASS_THROUGH);        }`  Allow @ replacement to deal with check_plain (same functionality as doing a direct drupal_set_title) and make drupal_set_title bypass check plain.    This behaviour is also seen in islandora core, when editing an object label (properties management) and adding html to the label, makes the ""delete button"" which displays the object label double encode html and entities.  At: https://github.com/Islandora/islandora/blob/7.x/includes/object_properties.form.inc#L89-L90    The label is passed as @ which already does check_plain and then during theming drupal uses https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/includes%21common.inc/function/drupal_attributes/7  applying check_plain() again.

ISLANDORA-1623, 'Show More / Show Less' on field values with a maximum length," 'Show More / Show Less' will produce munged up code when linking a trimmed field value to object page or search results page when configured to be of maximum length. I believe the culprit is here: https://github.com/Islandora/islandora_solr_search/blob/7.x/includes/utilities.inc#L356 (wrapping links in links?). I have been able to reproduce this locally, and as the code implies, this only appears happens on display fields that are trimmed to a max length AND linked to a search result or object page. This creates broken or invalid html, and as a result, causes unexpected behavior with surrounding elements. Namely, the show more and show less links not functioning.     --Steps to Reproduce--  1: Add a default display field of appropriate length  2: Click configure  3: Select 'Link this field to the object's page. ' or 'Link the value to a Solr search result.'  4: Expand Maximum Length field set, and select 'Limit length of whole field'  5: Add a Maximum Length less then the characters that would appear in the value of the selected field.      --Test Case--  Follow the steps to reproduce, and ensure the show more/show less links produce valid output, and function as intended.

The collapsible list of months and days gets updated to reflect the issues in the current year, but the user can't see it since it is *above* the browser window's top horizon and out of view.

I'm honestly not sure whether there's a simple/logical way to make the XSLT understand when a field that contains data is in fact empty.

The Drupal contrib module datepicker also defines a datepicker element http://cgit.drupalcode.org/datepicker/tree/datepicker.module?h=7.x-1.x#n6.    The islandora_usage_stats module requires datepicker to be enabled to use datepicker_views for some date filtering functionality. As such when islandora_usage_stats and islandora_xml_forms are present on the same box install things collide and won't work as expected.    The Drupal date module supplies a date_popup module which provides the same functionality with an added time element. The common thread between islandora_xml_forms, datepicker and date_popup is they all utilize the same datepicker JS functionality so UI wise not much differs.   Similarly using the '#timepicker' => FALSE option on date_popup will render an identical element to islandora_xml_forms datepicker element functionality and all. The problem lies in that these custom properties aren't exposed to be set through formbuilder.    As such I see a couple of potential courses of action:  -Document around this (probably not the best)  -Deprecate and remove the element from islandora_xml_forms  -Rename the existing element within islandora_xml_forms to be unique    Grepping through all of core Islandora none of the forms/anywhere else are using an element type of '#datepicker'.

Note: This ticket is created as sensitive, [~manez], [~nruest] or whomever can deem to open it. Similarly, I will push to my fork referencing these JIRA tickets but won't open pulls for the time being.    Changes being made:    Islandora:  -Removing the ""download_clip"" endpoint from the Islandora module and moving it to the OpenSeadragon module as that's the only place it's actually used.    Islandora OpenSeadragon:  -Changes to what parameters are being passed through the 'clip' $_GET parameter. Previously a fully constructed URL was passed through representing the URL to Djatoka. Now only the rft_id/svc.region parameters for Djatoka will be set on the clip ID as well as the dimensions of the current image. Any other parameters passed through 'clip' $_GET parameter will be ignored (https://github.com/jordandukart/islandora_openseadragon/blob/7.x-ISLANDORA-1696/includes/utilities.inc#L30-L85 and https://github.com/jordandukart/islandora_openseadragon/blob/7.x-ISLANDORA-1696/js/islandora_openseadragon.js#L64-L71)  -The URL constructed will use the Djatoka URL configured through the admin page for the module. Note that I tested this with both a relative and absolute URL.  -Downloading a clip will only occur if the 'clip' $_GET parameter constitutes a valid URL otherwise will drupal_access_denied and watchdog if not.

Ideally we could pull this out into Islandora OpenSeadragon but this comes with complications. Seeing as it references a theme call in its callback (https://github.com/Islandora/islandora/blob/7.x/islandora.module#L684) all implementations (large image/newspaper sps) of this would have to be updated to reference the new islandora_openseadragon prefixed hook.

We've disabled the multithreading for now (and completed a re-index successfully) and may revisit the issue in the future if the amount of resources on your system changes.  bq. ... (later) ...  bq. The underlying issue is mysql can't handle bulk updates when all the Drupal filters connections are enabled in Fedora. The connections are required for Fedora to authenticate against Drupal; there is a connection for each multisite and Fedora tests each connections for every request it receives.   bq.

ISLANDORA-1738,Make Embargoes Reference RELS-EXT/RELS-INT Predicates,"w/r/t:  Discussion occurring on https://github.com/Islandora/islandora_ontology/pull/5  As well as its related ontology ticket https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/ISLANDORA-1727    Embargoes use a custom predicate URI; this seems to have been done with the intent of being able to embargo both datastreams and full objects without having to determine which predicate URI (RELS-EXT or RELS-INT) is appropriate.    This gives us the problem of having an ontology that's a little more fractured than it should be; our ontology would have to reference a custom URI that is only ever used once, and in a situation where existing RELS-EXT or RELS-INT URIs would be more appropriate.    --Technical Approach--  To fix this, we should:    - Modify existing queries that look for embargoes to search in both the RELS-EXT and RELS-INT, or in whichever one is appropriate for the situation.  - Update the embargo applicator so that it assigns the correct predicate based on whether what's being updated is a datastream or a full object  - Create an update hook that searches for embargoes using the old info:islandora predicate and runs the updated embargo applicator on them    This is based on a cursory glance at the module. We should also dig a little further to ensure that nothing else will break.    --Test Case--  This is a little delicate, so we should:    - Test the update hook against a few dozen embargoes of different types  - Test the existing embargo re-applicator against the same  - Test creating embargoes of different types against both objects and datastreams  - Test lifting embargoes  - Test the embargo management UI    --Impact--  We'd be messing with the way that embargoes are generated, so a thorough check of different types of embargoes is critical to ensure that nobody's embargoes are affected.    ----  QA Dan  Developer  discoverygarden inc. | Managing Digital Co",Scholar Module,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This causes timeouts or memory limits to be reached on exceptionally large collections.    *Steps to Reproduce*  With checksumming enabled, retroactively apply checksums to a collection with a massive number of objects. If the amount of time it takes to retroactively apply checksums is greater than PHP's max execution time, the batch will time out and fail. If the size of the batch definition array is greater than PHP's memory limit, it can also be expected to fail.    *The fix*  To fix, we should apply checksums in batch chunks of, say, 10. We should also create a drush script that uses this functionality; that way, we can take advantage of Drush's Batch API magic. We should also complete ISLANDORA-1660 in conjunction with this; the extra time it takes to generate checksums due to derivative generation and hook firing is negatively impacting the amount of time the retroactive batch takes.",Checksum,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Additionally, by using object createdDates instead of datastream lastModifiedDates, we may not be checking checksummed datastreams that have recently been modified.    **Suggested Improvements**  Because Checksum Checker is currently implemented on many sites, the existing query should not be deprecated, as this would cause checks to be re-done on objects where that may not be desirable.

For example, in our implementation, we allow an object to be related to more than one collection.  So, our Solr field RELS_EXT_isMemberOfCollection_uri_ms will store these relationship.  We are expecting to see multiple links, but the result is that both collection names are wrapped with a link to only the first collection's object_url.    Additionally, it also seems that the link is made to the object behind the search result -- while the related field value points to another object in the system.  This may be outside of the scope of this issue, but an additional option to ""Link to URL alias that matches field's original value."" would be perfect - and to have the option to override the displayed text by displaying a related field's value.      In the search results, the link we currently see for an object that has more than one collection:  {{<a href=""/islandora/object/pitt%3A31735051653909"" title=""Greek Room in the Cathedral of Learning, University of Pittsburgh"">info:fedora/pitt:collection.3, info:fedora/pitt:collection.6</a>  }}    What we expect to see for that same object (at least to address the Bug aspect of this ticket):  {{<a href=""/islandora/object/pitt:collection.3"" title=""Greek Room in the Cathedral of Learning, University of Pittsburgh"">info:fedora/pitt:collection.3</a>  <a href=""/islandora/object/pitt:collection.6"" title=""Greek Room in the Cathedral of Learning, University of Pittsburgh"">info:fedora/pitt:collection.6</a>}}    Optimally, (if all configuration options are added for the new link target and optional field to override the link text (in this example with fgs_label_s)) we'd hope to see:  {{<a href=""/islandora/object/pitt:collection.3"" title=""Pitt Publications"">Pitt Publications</a><br />  <a href=""/islandora/object/pitt:collection.6"" title=""Pitt Nationality Rooms"">Pitt Nationality Rooms</a>}}  ",Solr Search,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
